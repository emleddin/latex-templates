This repository contains different LaTeX project templates. 
They probably wouldn't exist without the support of TeX Exchange.

Individual projects are contained in labeled folders. These may include 
subfolders named "images" (or similar). To compile as-is, you'll need 
these subfolders in a directory with a similar structure. Thus, if you intend
to work on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), create a subfolder with the
same title and include the images.
