# latex-templates

This repository contains different LaTeX project templates.
They probably wouldn't exist without the support of TeX Exchange.

Individual projects are contained in labeled folders. These may include
subfolders named "images" (or similar). To compile as-is, you'll need
these subfolders in a directory with a similar structure. Thus, if you intend
to work on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), create a subfolder with the
same title and include the images.

- `basic-document`: A document with some of my favorite/most-used options.
- `business-cards`: Sample business cards.
- `data-update`: A template for a project status update.
It is useful for making a lot of image-based comparisons.
- `horizonatal-poster`: Sample horizontal 48x36in research poster.
- `lookalike-article-pub`: A template to recreate the formatting of a journal
article. It *should not* be use to submit to a journal.
- `lookalike-comm-pub`: A template to recreate the formatting of a journal
communication. It *should not* be use to submit to a journal.
- `lookalike-SI-pub`: A template to recreate the formatting of a the supporting
(or supplemental) information of a publication.
It could potentially be used to submit to a journal, if you really wanted, as
the SI requirements are often less strict.
- `vertical-poster`: Sample vertical 36x48in research poster.
