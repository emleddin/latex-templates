%% Uncomment the following lines for a figure to appear; changing the name in the \frame line, inserting a caption, and changing the label name.
%% To reference images in the future, use something like \ref{fig:example}
%% Hint: You'll need to compile twice for the bibliography and reference labeling to work

%% Uncomment the following lines for a table to appear; changing the number of columns 
%% (where {|c|c|c} makes 3 columns with dividers and {c c c} has 3 columns without dividers), inserting a caption, and changing the label name.
%% To reference the table in the future, use something like \ref{table:example}
%% Columns are divided through ampersands (&), new lines are stared with (\\), and bottom separator lines are created with (\hline)
%% Units are easily added using the options of the siunitx package, and an example is shown here
%% This is what a properly formatted table looks like, but if you have an incredible amount of data/are using LaTeX on your own, 
%% I recommend using a website like https://www.tablesgenerator.com/
%% Hint: You'll need to compile twice for the bibliography and reference labeling to work
